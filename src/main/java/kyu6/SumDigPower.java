/**
 * We need a function to collect these numbers, that may receive two integers aaa, bbb that defines the range [a,b][a, b][a,b] (inclusive) and outputs a list of the sorted numbers in the range that fulfills the property described above.
 * Examples
 * Let's see some cases (input -> output):
 * 1, 10  --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
 * 1, 100 --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 89]
 * If there are no numbers of this kind in the range
 * [a,b][a, b][a,b] the function should output an empty list.
 * 90, 100 --> []
 * Enjoy it!!
